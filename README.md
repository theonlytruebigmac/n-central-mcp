# N-central MCP Server

> A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for **N-able N-central** — exposing the N-central REST API as MCP tools, resources, and prompts for use with any MCP-compatible client.

---

## Efficiency warning

- This is currently **very** input token inefficient. A proper CLI and skill will need to be developed for better output handling/agent reliability. The current MCP-native implementation shouldn't be used in long term production environments.

## Features at a Glance

- **87 tools** covering devices, device notes, organizations, users, custom properties, scheduled tasks, PSA integrations, maintenance windows, and reporting — full coverage of the N-central REST API
- **Three write modes**: `read-only`, `write` (default), `full` — controls which tools are exposed
- **Auto-paginated bulk reports** in CSV or JSON; per-endpoint concurrency caps tuned to N-central's documented limits
- **MCP Resources** for live org-hierarchy context (`ncentral://org-tree`) and per-entity lookups via templated URIs
- **MCP Prompts** for common audit and reporting workflows
- **Two transports**: stdio (for Claude Desktop / local clients) and Streamable HTTP (for remote clients, MCP Inspector, etc.)
- **Single- or multi-tenant**: self-host against one N-central (env credentials), or run one hosted server many users point at — each targeting their *own* N-central via per-request headers (`NC_MULTI_TENANT=1`), with strict per-request credential isolation. See the **[Setup & Client Guide](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md)**
- **Production-grade auth**: JWT exchange with auto-refresh, hash-based bearer-token auth for the HTTP endpoint, CORS allow-list, rate limiting, audit log
- **Operability**: `/healthz` and `/metrics` (Prometheus text format) endpoints, structured audit logging, configurable retry/timeout/session caps

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 22.9** (uses the built-in `--env-file-if-exists` flag and `fetch`)
- An **N-central instance** you can reach over HTTPS
- A **User-API JWT token** generated in the N-central UI

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Get your N-central JWT token

In the N-central UI: **Administration → User Management → Users → [user] → API Access → Generate JSON Web Token**

> **Best practice:** Use a dedicated API-only user with least-privilege roles. The API user password rotates every 90 days — regenerate the JWT proactively to avoid 500 errors.

### 3. Configure your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set NC_SERVER_URL and NC_JWT_TOKEN at minimum.
```

The most common variables (full list in [.env.example](.env.example)):

| Variable | Required when | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NC_SERVER_URL` | single-tenant | Your N-central URL, e.g. `https://ncentral.example.com`. *Not* needed in multi-tenant mode |
| `NC_JWT_TOKEN` | single-tenant | User-API JWT from the N-central UI. *Not* needed in multi-tenant mode |
| `NC_MULTI_TENANT` | hosted mode | Set to `1` to require per-request `X-NC-FQDN`/`X-NC-JWT` headers (HTTP only). See [Multi-Tenant Mode](#multi-tenant-hosted-mode) |
| `NC_FQDN_ALLOWLIST` | multi-tenant | Comma-separated host suffixes a client may target — SSRF guard (exact or DNS-suffix match) |
| `NC_WRITE_MODE` | optional | `read-only` \| `write` \| `full` (default `write`) |
| `MCP_PORT` | HTTP mode only | Setting this enables HTTP mode (omit for stdio) |
| `MCP_API_KEY` | HTTP mode | Bearer token clients must present. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. **Required** unless `MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1` |
| `MCP_BIND_ADDRESS` | optional | Interface to bind. `127.0.0.1` (default) for localhost-only; `0.0.0.0` for Docker / LAN exposure |
| `MCP_CORS_ORIGIN` | browser clients | Comma-separated allow-list of origins |

> **Connecting a client?** See the **[Setup & Client Guide](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md)** for copy-paste config for Claude Code, VS Code, Claude Desktop, and Cursor — in both single- and multi-tenant modes.

#### Write modes

| Mode | Tool count | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| `read-only` | 56 | GET endpoints only |
| `write` *(default)* | 82 | Read tools + create/update tools (POST/PUT/PATCH) |
| `full` | 87 | Everything, including destructive tools: `delete_device`, `delete_maintenance_windows`, `delete_device_note`, `clear_device_notes`, `create_direct_scheduled_task` |

All write/destructive tools are audit-logged. Start in `read-only`, move to `write` once the integration is trusted, and reserve `full` for vetted automation.

### 4. Start the server

The server runs in **stdio mode** by default and switches to **HTTP mode** when `MCP_PORT` is set.

**Option A — stdio (Claude Desktop / local clients)**

Use the npm script (loads `.env` if present):

```bash
npm start
```

Or wire it into Claude Desktop directly. Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ncentral": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["--env-file-if-exists=/absolute/path/to/n-central-mcp/.env", "/absolute/path/to/n-central-mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NC_WRITE_MODE": "read-only"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B — Streamable HTTP (remote clients, MCP Inspector)**

Set `MCP_PORT` in `.env` (default `3100`) and an `MCP_API_KEY`, then:

```bash
npm run start:http
# Listening at http://127.0.0.1:3100/mcp
# Health probe: http://127.0.0.1:3100/healthz
# Metrics:      http://127.0.0.1:3100/metrics
```

Clients send `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>` on every request.

**Option C — Docker**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: NC_SERVER_URL, NC_JWT_TOKEN, MCP_API_KEY are required for the HTTP listener.
docker compose up -d
```

Compose maps `127.0.0.1:3100:3100` by default. To expose on the LAN, edit `docker-compose.yml` and ensure `MCP_API_KEY` is set.

### 5. Verify

```bash
# stdio mode — should print "Authenticated with N-central..." on first tool call.
# HTTP mode — should respond:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3100/healthz
# {"status":"ok","sessions":0}
```

---

## Multi-Tenant (Hosted) Mode

By default the server is **single-tenant**: it reads one `NC_SERVER_URL` + `NC_JWT_TOKEN` from
its environment. That's the right model for an MSP self-hosting it against a single N-central.

Set **`NC_MULTI_TENANT=1`** to host **one** server that many users point at, each targeting a
**different** N-central server with their **own** JWT — supplied per request via headers in their
own MCP client config. (Intended for a centrally-hosted demo/eval box, not for routing third
parties' production credentials through infrastructure you don't control.)

```bash
# Hosted server (HTTP only — stdio cannot carry per-request headers):
NC_MULTI_TENANT=1 \
MCP_PORT=3100 \
MCP_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
NC_FQDN_ALLOWLIST=ncentral.com,n-able.com \
node index.js
```

Each user's MCP client config sends, per request:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ncentral": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>",       // gates access to THIS server
        "X-NC-FQDN": "https://their-ncentral.example.com",
        "X-NC-JWT":  "<their N-central User-API JWT>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Isolation guarantees**

- **One session = one tenant.** Credentials are validated at session init (before the session
  exists); an invalid/missing header pair is rejected with `400`. The tenant is then bound to the
  session for its lifetime — later header changes on the same session are ignored.
- **No shared credential state.** Tokens are keyed per tenant and resolved per request via
  `AsyncLocalStorage`, so concurrent requests for different servers can never read each other's
  URL or token. The resource cache is tenant-scoped for the same reason.
- **Memory only, auto-evicted.** Tokens and cache entries live in memory and are dropped when the
  last session for a tenant closes. Nothing is persisted; JWTs are never logged.
- **SSRF guard.** `NC_FQDN_ALLOWLIST` restricts which N-central hosts a client may target (exact
  or DNS-suffix match). Leave it unset only behind trusted network boundaries — the server warns
  at startup if it's empty.

**Scaling.** The event loop handles many concurrent users on one process (the work is I/O-bound —
waiting on N-central). If you outgrow one process, run replicas behind a load balancer with
**sticky routing by `mcp-session-id`** — StreamableHTTP sessions live in process memory, so a
session must return to the replica that created it.

> **Tip — multiple servers without hosting:** a self-hoster who just needs to target several
> N-central servers from their own editor can skip multi-tenant mode entirely and define one
> stdio entry per server, each with its own `env: { NC_SERVER_URL, NC_JWT_TOKEN }`.

## Tools

Each tool is tagged with its required write mode:

- 🟢 **read** — available in every mode
- 🟡 **write** — requires `NC_WRITE_MODE=write` or `full`
- 🔴 **destructive** — requires `NC_WRITE_MODE=full`

### Pagination

Every `list_*` tool returns a single page by default (with pagination metadata: `pageNumber`, `pageSize`, `totalItems`, `totalPages`, `_links`). To retrieve every result across all pages in one call, pass `all: true` — the server will auto-paginate at 200 items per page (up to 40,000 items). For CSV/JSON exports over large datasets, use the matching `report_*` tool instead.

## Resources

Resources provide live context to the client without requiring explicit tool calls. Hierarchical resources are cached for 60s by default — set `NC_RESOURCE_CACHE_TTL_MS=0` to disable.

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `ncentral://org-tree` | Full SO → Customer → Site hierarchy with IDs and names |
| `ncentral://status` | Server health + version snapshot |
| `ncentral://device/{deviceId}` | Templated — full device record by ID |
| `ncentral://customer/{customerId}` | Templated — customer details by ID |
| `ncentral://org-unit/{orgUnitId}` | Templated — org unit details by ID |

---

## Prompts

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `full-customer-report` | Comprehensive customer/site report with org custom properties |
| `device-health-audit` | Active issues and monitoring status across the environment |
| `agent-deployment-status` | Find sites with missing or low device counts |
| `custom-property-audit` | Audit custom property consistency across all customers |

---

## Resilience

| Concern | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Rate limits (429) | Auto-retry with exponential backoff on all methods (up to 3 attempts) |
| Unauthorized (401) | Auto re-authenticates from JWT and replays the request on all methods |
| Token expiry | Access tokens (1hr) and refresh tokens (25hr) auto-refreshed; concurrent refreshes coalesced |
| Server errors (500/503) | Retried on GET/PUT/DELETE (idempotent). POST/PATCH fail fast to avoid duplicate writes |
| Request timeouts | 30s on API calls, 15s on auth calls. Retried on idempotent methods only |
| Stale HTTP sessions | Cleaned up after 30 minutes of inactivity |

---

## Known API Quirks

- **Probe assets:** Return 404 — probes don't have asset records (expected behavior, skipped in bulk reports)
- **Active issues:** `deviceClassValue` and `deviceClassLabel` are always `null` (known N-central API bug)
- **`get_device` by ID:** `lastLoggedInUser` and `stillLoggedIn` may return `null` — use `list_devices` instead for these fields. (`lastApplianceCheckinTime` was also missing pre-v2025.3.1.9 — now fixed.)
- **Active issues at SO level:** The `/active-issues` endpoint only supports customer/site org unit types, not service org
- **Scheduled task `/details`:** does NOT accept DEVICE-level task IDs — only SYSTEM and CUSTOMER. Navigate via `parentId` if you have a device task ID.
- **`create_direct_scheduled_task`:** Scripts must have Repository ID ≥ 2000 and "Enable API" toggled ON in the N-central UI. There's no API to enumerate scripts — find IDs in the Script/Software Repository UI. Extensive use accumulates DB rows that slow the UI's Task Execution page.
- **`validate_psa_credential`:** only works with TigerPaw 3.0 — calls for other PSAs will fail.
- **Per-endpoint concurrency limits:** N-central enforces concurrency per-endpoint (range 1-50). `/api/devices` allows 5 concurrent; `/api/devices/{id}/assets/lifecycle-info` only 1. Bulk reports default to safe values; tune via the `concurrency` parameter.
- **PREVIEW endpoints:** `create_site` and `create_user_role` are flagged PREVIEW by N-central — the request/response shape may change between versions
- **Credentialed POST endpoints:** `validate_psa_credential`, `get_custom_psa_ticket_detail`, and `get_server_info_authenticated` transmit plaintext credentials in request bodies — only use over HTTPS and be mindful of audit-log contents
- **`select` is a filter, not a projection:** despite the name, the `select` query parameter on list endpoints is a **FIQL/RSQL predicate** that filters rows. It does NOT pick which fields come back. Valid: `select=soId==50` (returns only that SO). Invalid: `select=soId,soName` (parse error). Not all fields are queryable — unsupported ones error with `Field not found: X`. Some operators (e.g. `=gt=`) throw NPEs on the server.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 500 errors on every API call | N-central API user password expired (rotates every 90 days) | Reset the password in N-central UI; regenerate the JWT; set a reminder for ~80 days |
| Repeated `Got 401, re-authenticating...` logs | N-central instance was rebooted (in-memory token state lost) | First 401 triggers re-auth; subsequent calls recover automatically. Noisy on restart but transient. |
| JWT works now but fails 5 minutes later | Token revocation propagation | After regenerating a JWT in N-central UI, allow up to 5 minutes for the old token's revocation to propagate |
| Server restart loses authentication state | Tokens are stored in-memory only | First API call after restart triggers fresh JWT exchange — no action needed |
| Can't reach the API on a custom port | N-central only serves the API on port 443 | Use a reverse proxy or accept port 443 |
| `create_direct_scheduled_task` errors with no script found | Repository ID < 2000 (bundled default) or "Enable API" toggle is OFF | Use a custom-uploaded script; toggle "Enable API" in the UI |
| Reaching `MAX_PAGES` errors on big environments | `fetchAll` caps at 200 pages × 200 items (40k rows) | Use a tighter filter via the `select` parameter, or call the underlying tool with explicit `pageNumber`/`pageSize` |
| HTTP mode exits with "FATAL: MCP_PORT is set but MCP_API_KEY is not" | Safety check — HTTP mode requires an API key | Set `MCP_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)` or `MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1` for local dev |
| `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` / can't reach `/healthz`/`/metrics` from another machine | Server bound or published to localhost only | Set `MCP_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0`; in Docker publish `0.0.0.0:3100:3100` (not `127.0.0.1:3100:3100`) and connect to the host's **LAN IP**, not `localhost`. If `curl 127.0.0.1:3100/healthz` works *on the host* but not remotely, it's the bind/publish scope |
| Client connects but queries the **wrong** N-central / `X-NC-*` headers ignored | Server not started with `NC_MULTI_TENANT=1` | In single-tenant mode the headers are ignored and env `NC_SERVER_URL`/`NC_JWT_TOKEN` are used. Start with `NC_MULTI_TENANT=1` for header passthrough |
| `400` at connect in multi-tenant mode | Missing/invalid `X-NC-FQDN` / `X-NC-JWT` | Send both; FQDN must be `https://` and match `NC_FQDN_ALLOWLIST` if set |
| "FATAL: NC_MULTI_TENANT=1 requires HTTP mode" | Multi-tenant needs per-request headers, which stdio can't carry | Set `MCP_PORT` (run in HTTP mode) |
